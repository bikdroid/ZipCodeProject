Inputs : rangeinput and rangeinput2 2D arrays in main(), can be modified to add more zip codes.

ZipCode 		: class to store information for a single ZipCode.
ZipCodeRange 		: class to store a lower and upper ZipCode objects, and implement compare functions.

JUnitTests : JUnit tests for checking each conditions like seperate ranges, overlapping ranges.

Libraries Used : jdk 1.8, junit, hamcrest.
